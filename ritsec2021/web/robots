the challenge was hosted in this static page http://34.69.61.54:5247
This page have 1 picture,some description and some CSS to beautify the page.
There aren't forms to submit data, for this reason i start to search information capture information by starting to read the html code at my disposal.
I did not find anything relevant and so I started reading well what was written and I tried to put something in the url that could be connected to the flag.
I immediately tried to insert flag.txt (http://34.69.61.54:5247/flag.txt) in the url which redirected to an encoded string that hide a message that was not the flag.
So thanks to a correct observation of a teammate of mine it was discovered that the right file to view was the robots.txt (http://34.69.61.54:5247/robots.txt) file and there is a particular encoded entry in them

Allow: / flag / UlN7UjBib3RzX2FyM19iNGR9

decoding it you get the flag -> https://www.base64decode.org/ (base64 decoding tool)
