The challenge was hosted by http://challs.dvc.tf:5555/ 
inspecting the source code of the web page (roght click -> inspect/analyze element) there was a strange JS.
If you pay attention to the source there was a string URIencoded like %01%02%03.
This style of encoding is adopted by browsers to encode special characters.
If you use decodeURI("%64%76%43%54%46%7b%31%74%5f%69%73%5f%6e%30%74%5f%34%5f%73%65%63%72%33%74%5f%34%6e%79%6d%30%72%33%7d") you get the flag.
if you want to do more, i can suggest you these two tools to de-obfuscate the JS -> https://beautifier.io/ and https://www.dcode.fr/javascript-unobfuscator
you can simply pasted the code into this 2 tool and the JS
