Thanks to Geno's LinkedIn profile, i went back to the profile of the company where he works and then to the CEO *Dr. JoAnne Turner-Frey*.

Then I searched for his twitter profile so I could have the background photo of the profile.

</p>

At this point, from the description of the challenge i extracted a fundamental information, namely that *The CEO of Geno’s company loves local art and nature*.
So, being JoAnne from Rochester (NY), i started looking for the background photo in the parks and after a couple of times i "visited" the *Peace Sign Garden Durand Eastman Park* and in the photos that Google Maps made available, i found the one of interest and then i found the flag.
