# Solution

On his [about.me page](https://about.me/genoikonomov) there are all the links to his social media accounts.

Both on his Twitter and Facebook accounts there was some sort of connection with a girl named Claire Alexa (@eng_claire). 

There are many *music signs* sprinkled on his social media, but her twitter bio seems kinda interesting:

Opening the link to her [Spotify account](https://t.co/en0Upor4Uc?amp=1), we can find an interesting playlist named RS:

I noticed the vertical pattern (an acrostic) going from RS to {}, that made sense completed with the initials of the song titles, which can definitely *tell us something about her personality*:

`RS{Sagittarius}`
