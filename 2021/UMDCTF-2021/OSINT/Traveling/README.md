# Solution

The first thing that I noticed was the "500 PINE" street address. I looked on Google Maps and I found [this address](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hpP6Qnv7XL5EJewXA) in San Francisco.

The building shaped like the one in the picture is the one we're looking for. To make sure, I took a look in Google Street View confirming my idea.
